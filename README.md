# Origin Resurrected Template

This used to be the [default template for DokuWiki](http://dokuwiki.org/template:default) until 2012.
It was designed by Andreas Gohr and also contributed to by the open source community.
It was extracted from the core late 2013 and since then not actively maintained by the core developers anymore.
Now the default template for dokuwiki [is called dokuwiki](http://dokuwiki.org).

However me [desbest](http://desbest.com) have managed to add some minor changes to make it compatible with 2018 Greebo.

* Metadata is in template.info.txt
